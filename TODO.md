# Navigation Fix - Laws Button Redirection

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Laws Button Navigation
- **Issue**: The "Laws" button in the header was using an anchor link (`#laws`) that tried to scroll to a non-existent element
- **Solution**: Changed the href from `"#laws"` to `"/laws"` to match the routing pattern

### 2. Updated Both Navbar Components
- **Navbar.jsx**: Updated the laws button href to `"/laws"`
- **Navbar_new.jsx**: Updated the laws button href to `"/laws"`

### 3. Verified Target Destination
- **"Explore Laws" button** in Cards.jsx correctly navigates to `/laws` route
- **LawsPage component** is properly configured at the `/laws` route in App_final.jsx

## üéØ Result
Now both buttons redirect to the same page:
- **Header "Laws" button** ‚Üí `/laws` ‚Üí LawsPage component
- **"Explore Laws" button** ‚Üí `/laws` ‚Üí LawsPage component
